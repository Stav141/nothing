    <h4 class="casual-text">
        i believe that one should know to distinguish himself from that which he doth define himself by. <br>

        man is conscious and intelligent; he doth partner with his physical self/body, and he hath the power to externalize from that body,
        recognizing that he is not at the center of existence, and he hath the capacity to know truth and truly feel beyond his skin.


        <blockquote>"The love that covers a multitude of sins is the love which takes away the sin of another or helps the other to take it away himself, 
        by loving him in such a way that he loves God. To love another person is to help him to love God. 
        his love for another person is based on equality before God and is a bond of perfection that unites all people before Him."<br> - Kierkegaard</blockquote> 

        <blockquote>"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son"<br> - John 3:16</blockquote>
