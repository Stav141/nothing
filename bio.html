    I BELIEVE THAT ONE SHOULD KNOW TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF FROM THAT WHAT HE DEFINES HIMSELF BY.<BR>

        MAN IS CONSCIOUS AND INTELLIGENT; HE IS DISTINCT TO HIS BODY, <BR> AND HE HAS THE CAPACITY TO EXTERNALIZE FROM HIS BODY,
        TO RECOGNIZE THAT HE'S NOT AT THE CENTER OF EXISTENCE,<BR> AND HE HAS THE CAPACITY TO KNOW THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND FEEL WHAT HE COULDN'T FEEL.<BR><BR>


        <BLOCKQUOTE>"THE LOVE THAT COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS IS THE LOVE WHICH TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF ANOTHER OR HELPS THE OTHER TO TAKE IT AWAY HIMSELF, <BR>
        BY LOVING HIM IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE LOVES GOD. TO LOVE ANOTHER  <BR>PERSON IS TO HELP HIM TO LOVE GOD. 
        HIS LOVE FOR ANOTHER PERSON IS BASED ON EQUALITY BEFORE GOD AND IS A BOND OF PERFECTION <BR>THAT UNITES ALL PEOPLE BEFORE HIM."<BR> - KIERKEGAARD<BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
